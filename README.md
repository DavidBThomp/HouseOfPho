## Changes
The original site was a image on HTML page. This worked when the viewer was on a wide viewport, but this approach fails on smaller viewports and lacks basic website functionality. The ability to copy, click, and navigate the site needs to be implemented.

## Updated Site
The new site has a new color theme, changs to the navigation, and is mobile responsive.
